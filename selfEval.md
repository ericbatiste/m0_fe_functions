# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    - I'm proud of how easy it is for me to sit down at the computer and work on these assignments.  It makes me feel very confident that I have made the right choice in choosing to attend Turing.
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
    - Functions allow us to write modular, reuseable code that we can run at a choosen time rather than sequentially.
